# Rule: Pull Request Title and Description for KaraYaml (ask-only)

Purpose: When asked to write a PR title and PR description for karayaml, respond with exactly two copyable code blocks — first the title, then the description — without making any repository changes.

This rule is designed for ask mode only. Do not modify files, run commands, or propose edits. Output only the two fenced code blocks described below.

Usage: In Ask mode, invoke explicitly as `@generate-karayaml-pr-info` or `@pr-info`.

## How to respond (strict)
1) First block: PR Title
   - Fenced code block with language: `text`
   - Single line only
   - Prefix using Conventional Commits: one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `build`, `chore`, `revert`
   - Scope is required and must be component-aware, using a token derived from changed files (examples below)
   - Imperative mood, concise, ≤ 72 characters after the prefix
   - No trailing period

2) Second block: PR Description
   - Fenced code block with language: `markdown`
   - Use the following sections when applicable. Omit any that are not relevant.
     - "Summary": 1-3 sentences describing what this PR does in plain language
     - "Context": Why this change is needed (problem, bug, or goal)
     - "Changes": Bullet list of key changes; group by area if helpful
     - "Implementation notes": Important design decisions or trade-offs
     - "Breaking changes": Clearly call out any breaking behavior and migration steps
     - "Test plan": How this was verified (tests, manual steps, screenshots/links)
     - "Risks": Known risks or rollback plan
     - "Checklist": Markdown checkboxes for docs, tests, backward compatibility
     - Optionally include issue links like `Closes #123` when known

## Title format (exactly)

```text
<prefix>(<scope>): <concise, imperative title>
```

- Examples of valid scopes: `cmd`, `cmd/root`, `internal/shortcuts`, `internal/karabinerconfig`, `internal/defaulteditor`, `internal/upgrade`, `site`, `build`, `release`, `deps`, `docs`, `readme`, `repo`.

## How to infer the title prefix
- `feat`: Adds a new capability, command, flag, alias, or config that users can opt into
- `fix`: Corrects a bug or regression
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing externally visible behavior
- `docs`: Documentation-only changes (`*.md`, docs)
- `test`: Tests only
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI pipeline/config changes
- `build`: Build system or dependency changes (Makefile, GoReleaser, go.mod)
- `chore`: Routine maintenance (formatting, small cleanups) not covered above
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit/PR

Prefer `feat` vs `refactor` based on whether user-facing capability is introduced. Prefer `fix` when the primary intent is to resolve a defect, even if some refactoring was required.

## Scope heuristics (karayaml repository)
Determine the `<scope>` from the changed files. Use the most impacted area by lines changed; if multiple, see multi-area guidance below.

- Core Commands
  - `cmd/karayaml/root/*.go` -> `cmd` or `cmd/<specific-command>` (e.g., `cmd/find`, `cmd/filter`)
  - If multiple commands affected -> `cmd`

- Internal Packages
  - `internal/shortcuts/**` -> `internal/shortcuts`
  - `internal/karabinerconfig/**` -> `internal/karabinerconfig`
  - `internal/defaulteditor/**` -> `internal/defaulteditor`
  - `internal/upgrade/**` -> `internal/upgrade`
  - Multiple internal packages -> `internal`

- Site (Landing Page)
  - `site/**` -> `site`
  - `site/src/components/**` -> `site` (unless very specific)

- Build and Configuration
  - `Makefile` or `scripts/` -> `build`
  - `.goreleaser.yaml` -> `release`
  - `go.mod`, `go.sum` -> `deps`
  - `.gitignore`, `.github/**` -> `repo`

- Documentation
  - `README.md` (root) -> `readme`
  - `docs/**` or other markdown files -> `docs`

### Multi-area changes
- If changes span multiple internal packages, use `internal`
- If changes span commands and internal packages, use the primary area or omit scope
- If changes are broadly cross-cutting (>=3 unrelated areas), use `repo`

## Inputs to use when generating
- The full diff and edit history from this session
- Changed files and their paths to infer scope using the rules above
- Commit messages, branch name, or linked issues if available

If context is insufficient to infer details, choose the best effort scope from filenames and touched areas. Do not ask questions; still produce both blocks.

## Output blocks (exactly two, nothing else)

<1-3 sentences>

## Context
<why this change was needed>

## Changes
- <key change 1>

## Implementation notes
- <notable decision or trade-off>

## Breaking changes
- <explicitly list or state "None">

## Test plan
- <how verified>

## Risks
- <risks and rollback>

## Checklist
- [ ] Docs updated (if needed)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (if needed)
- [ ] Backward compatible

<!-- Optionally: Closes #123 -->
```

## Example Output

For a change that adds a filter command with key and app subcommands:

```text
feat(cmd): add filter command with filter-key and filter-app subcommands
```

```markdown
## Summary
Adds a new `filter` parent command with `filter-key` and `filter-app` subcommands for filtering shortcuts by key or app/file path. Supports fuzzy substring matching by default and exact matching via `--exact` flag.

## Context
Users needed a way to narrow down their shortcut list by either the mapped key or the application path. The existing `find` command only searches by app name. A dedicated filter command provides more targeted lookup capabilities.

## Changes
- Add `filter` parent command in `cmd/karayaml/root/filter.go`
- Add `filter-key` subcommand with `--exact` flag in `cmd/karayaml/root/filter_key.go`
- Add `filter-app` subcommand with `--exact` flag in `cmd/karayaml/root/filter_app.go`
- Add `FilterByKey()` and `FilterByApp()` helper functions in `internal/shortcuts/list.go`
- Register `filter` command in root command

## Implementation notes
- Fuzzy matching uses case-insensitive substring containment, consistent with the existing `find` command behavior
- Exact matching uses case-insensitive equality
- Both subcommands reuse the existing `PrintMatches()` display function for consistent output formatting

## Breaking changes
- None

## Test plan
- Built and tested locally with `go build ./...`
- Verified `filter filter-key` and `filter filter-app` with both fuzzy and exact modes
- Verified existing commands are unaffected

## Risks
- Low risk: New commands only, no changes to existing behavior

## Checklist
- [ ] Docs updated (if needed)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (if needed)
- [x] Backward compatible
```
